# PYTHON WRANGLING
## PROBLEM:
Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?
## solution:
in thie problem we were given three files out of which one was a python file ,so first i tried to run it on a web compiler but it led to errors, i then looked at the hints given which were:
* Get the Python script accessible in your shell by entering the following command in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0bf545252b5120845e3b568b9ad0277e/ende.py
* $ man python
These made me realise that this problem must require terminal and not a python compiler, after looking at the man page i tried running the python file through the terminal in shwll using python3. and it gave me an output reguarding the commands usage.

I followed it and used -d flag (for decode) with our file and then provided the password which gave me the flag.
## FLAG
picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_6008014f}


# keygenme-py
## PROBLEM:
we are just given a code with no hints.


## BACKGROUND:
first i tried to run the code on a web compiler but i had trouble because of the cryptography module:

after this i tried running the code on vs code but had issues with compiling it which i could not rectify or understand.
SO i tried running the code on idle after installing cryptography module via the terminal.

## SOLUTION:
i was successfully able to run the code on idle after a silpe debugging of the try and except block,which gave me the output as

 after this i tried reading the code and realised the answer only concerns the enter_liscence()
functionand rest were redundant, so i focused my attention there,

this block tells us that
* the lenth of the key should be equal to the key_full_template_trial which is the concatenated string of key_part_static1_trial + key_part_dynamic1_trial + 
 key_part_static2_trial , so we can guess the length of the key from here which is picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_xxxxxxxx} characters long 
* the first part of string is equal to the static portion.
  ow we have to find the second part instead of the xxxxxx portion, loooking at further code we figure out what the next charaxters should be equal to in order to not break from the loop, so i print the statements with which we are checking the key

  this gives me an error stating that Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing so i look for what this means and fnd out that we are given another username bUsername_trial which is already encoded so i use it while printing and this given me the output and i build up my key using thiese and sure enough the key is right and im able to access the full verion of the calculator.

  ## KEY;
