# PYTHON WRANGLING
## PROBLEM:
Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?
## solution:
in thie problem we were given three files out of which one was a python file ,so first i tried to run it on a web compiler but it led to errors, i then looked at the hints given which were:
* Get the Python script accessible in your shell by entering the following command in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0bf545252b5120845e3b568b9ad0277e/ende.py
* $ man python
These made me realise that this problem must require terminal and not a python compiler, after looking at the man page i tried running the python file through the terminal in shwll using python3. and it gave me an output reguarding the commands usage.

I followed it and used -d flag (for decode) with our file and then provided the password which gave me the flag.

# keygenme-py
## PROBLEM:
we are just given a code with no hints.


## BACKGROUND:
first i tried to run the code on a web compiler but i had trouble because of the cryptography module:
![Screenshot from 2023-11-05 19-38-11](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/66297520-9fb2-41a7-9170-7b6889a476a5)

after this i tried running the code on vs code but had issues with compiling it which i could not rectify or understand.
SO i tried running the code on idle after installing cryptography module via the terminal.

## SOLUTION:
i was successfully able to run the code on idle after a silpe debugging of the try and except block,which gave me the output as
![Screenshot from 2023-11-05 19-19-25](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/f6ac6edb-4230-4849-adeb-4c87b19dd3d2)

 after this i tried reading the code and realised the answer only concerns the enter_liscence()
functionand rest were redundant, so i focused my attention there,
![Screenshot from 2023-11-05 19-24-08](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/1bc4f7ba-47bf-4cdd-8e45-0ce3915fffab)

this block tells us that
* the lenth of the key should be equal to the key_full_template_trial which is the concatenated string of key_part_static1_trial + key_part_dynamic1_trial + 
 key_part_static2_trial , so we can guess the length of the key from here which is picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_xxxxxxxx} characters long 
* the first part of string is equal to the static portion.
  ow we have to find the second part instead of the xxxxxx portion, loooking at further code we figure out what the next charaxters should be equal to in order to not break from the loop, so i print the statements with which we are checking the key

  this gives me an error stating that Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing so i look for what this means and fnd out that we are given another username bUsername_trial which is already encoded so i use it while printing and this given me the output and i build up my key using thiese and sure enough the key is right and im able to access the full verion of the calculator.

  ## KEY;
  picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_0d208392}

  # STOONKS
  ## problem
  I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c nc mercury.picoctf.net 33411
  * hint = Okay, maybe I'd believe you if you find my API key.

## SOLUTION
 first after downloading the code i tried running it on cs code on my machine which gave me an error in the following :
 ![Screenshot from 2023-11-08 10-45-22](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/2e1d9cef-c3e7-4bda-8fa7-5d00162261c5)
 as the format (data type ) of user_buf was not defined in the code.
 after studying a bit about printf and how it works i got to know that it prints what we want from a stack which is known as the buffer eg in printf ("%s", a)
 %s is our format in which we want the output and a is like an address in the buffer which we want in that particular format, in our code we only have a user_buf and if that is not present in the buffer and format is not defined , the printf statement just starts giving output of whatver is in the stack(buffer), we can specify the format of this output buy using format specifiers , in this problem i wanted all of the stuff whihc is in the stack since we dont know what format we are looking for so we use %x (hex) as the specifier as 
 ![Screenshot from 2023-11-08 11-44-53](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/2cec20ba-60d0-47ec-a3d2-ef4f9b02717b)

which gives us the output now we convert it into ascii using cyberchef
![Screenshot from 2023-11-08 11-54-21](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/37cc6f08-cc8d-4142-950d-f9cb2d7fe70c)
in this i was able to find something which looked like my flag but it was jumbled so i truncated the excess hex to just get my flag 
![Screenshot from 2023-11-08 11-55-51](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/2c16e2a2-e480-42cd-9f9d-e345c14b2f26)
now after reading a bit more abt how stuff is stored ina buffer i found i out that a maximim of 32 bits are stored in every slot of the stack and each ascii value is 8 bits that means 4 characters and that made sence as in the jumbled flag i could figure out that every group of 4 characters was written backwards 
so i manually broke the jumbled flag into parts of 4 and reversed each of them  and conctanated them together which gave me

# CAAS
## problem 
we are given a url of a web service in which we can make a cow say whatever we want and the code for the service in javascript.

## solution
First i opened the the url and from there we are directed as to how can we use the serive to mak the cow say words.
![Screenshot from 2023-11-14 19-12-56](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/78e12bb6-c4bc-462c-88a9-c03b74288ebb)
i tried saying hi 
after this i look at the js code which is given to us
![Screenshot from 2023-11-14 19-06-52](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/7ea04c10-348d-4638-9644-e84cbc53b4a2)

and find out that   exec(`/usr/games/cowsay ${req.params.message}`, {timeout: 5000}, (error, stdout) => {
command gives our message input to the command prompt and sends the commands output as a response
and that
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('listening');
});
starts the server and makes it listen on the 3000 port.
this made me realise that i can type commands in the url as https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/hi;ls;cat%20falg.txt to run the lines directly in the comand prompt and get the output

after reading the flag.txt file we get the flag , we use %20 for space as a url cannot have spaces.

# tunn3l v1s10n

## problem
we are given a file and been told to recover it 
## hint
Weird that it won't display right...

## solution
The first thing that i notice abt why cantr we open the file is that it dosent have a extension, so i tried to find out its type.
using terminal commands i couldnt find much so i researched abt how to find the type of a file , and i found out that the first two letters of the file head(first few lines of the file), guves us the type of file in our case BM which stands fir bitmap file.

![Screenshot from 2023-11-14 19-39-59](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/96754839-0179-447a-9525-48b23f8f324c)

so i tried to add the extension to the file and open it but that didnt work and i was still unable to open the file.
so i searched abt how to open bmp files and found an application called imagemagik so i decided to give it a try and sure enough it worked and i got a image but it still said not a flag.

![Screenshot from 2023-11-14 20-41-42](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/bfcba0cc-dba1-47a7-b30a-a314334d1802)

after going through what a non corrupted bitmap looks like in a hex editor i realised in the very beggning it said BAD i figured this was the corrupt part.

![Screenshot from 2023-11-14 20-51-50](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/8e596238-7bb5-4336-a1da-e08a54a57708)

so after comparing it to a normal bmp image and changing the values to

i am able to open the image normally without imagemagic but still not able to view the whole image.

to view the full image i then search where the boundaries of the image are in the hexeditor and find the maximum range for bmp images and change it

and sure enough after this im able to open the full image normally and get the flag

## problem
We found a brand new type of encryption, can you break the secret code? (Wrap with picoCTF{}) lkmjkemjmkiekeijiiigljlhilihliikiliginliljimiklligljiflhiniiiniiihlhilimlhijil
 we are also given the code for the encryption 
 ## hints
 How does the cipher work if the alphabet isn't 26 letters?
 Even though the letters are split up, the same paradigms still apply.

 ## solution 
after going through the code for the encryption i could figure out hoe the encryption works 
* first the code takes the string and converts it into binary which require 8bits per character then splits into groups of 4 bits and concerts them into characters
![Screenshot from 2023-11-15 10-41-36](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/4c990af8-cb35-4ec4-805e-2533a8352eb0)
* then the shift function takes a character c and our key character k and shifts c by k places and we know that our key character is one of the alphabets which gives us 16 possible keys , since 16 is not a large number we can easily bruteforce this.

to get the decryption we can try and reverse the encryption code .
first we make a code for reversing the b_16 encryption.
![Screenshot from 2023-11-15 11-22-09](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/95821df1-33aa-4b56-b900-4fc8153f49d6)
* in this we iterate over the encoded string in steps of 2 as each char is 4 bits and 2 characters would make a byte.
* then we convert our chunk of two characters(1 byte) to thier binary representation.
 in this expression {0:04b}{1:04b}".format(ALPHABET.index(chunk[0]), ALPHABET.index(chunk[1])):
* o and 1 are the place holders and 04b specifies the format (4 digit binary format)
* the next part gives the index of the first and second character in our chunk.
* after this we convert the binary string to characters and add it to plain.
now we make a reverse for the shifting

this takes a cgaracter c and the key character k and gives the decrypted character by shifting c bacnk by k places inthe alphabets.

next we print all possible decryptions (bruteforce) for every character in the alphabet since we dont know which one is actually the key
![Screenshot from 2023-11-15 11-36-32](https://github.com/adwait3/pico/assets/148553626/47517619-10e9-4232-8e4a-4f6d433f85bc)
this loop iterates in all the alphabets and calls various functions to give the decrypted output for each of them
## final code with output

this gives us the answers and after trial and erroe we get the final key f and decrypted answer et_tu?_431db62c5618cd75f1d0b83832b67b46

# forbidden paths
## problem
Can you get the flag?
Here's the website.
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
## solution
 first i siply tried to go and read the file /flag.txt but i got a message saying not authorised
 in our problem statement we are told that our website is filtering absolute paths , after studying a bit more about absolute and relative paths and found out that the main difference is going from the root path to our file and directly searching our file in the current directory so i tried to read the file by 
 * /usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt
but still i was not authorised
since the relative paths were getting filtered and our relative path /flag.txt was not authorised , i thought it was something related to hirarchy since it said not authorised and if we can more up hirarchy by relative path maybe we can get authorised to view the file withouth being filtered. so i tried ../ to move up a directory while using relative paths (as we are not specifing the directory name just using ../) we use this 4 times to move up to the parent directory and now after reading we get the flag.
