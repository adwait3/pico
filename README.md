# PYTHON WRANGLING
## PROBLEM:
Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?
## solution:
in thie problem we were given three files out of which one was a python file ,so first i tried to run it on a web compiler but it led to errors, i then looked at the hints given which were:
* Get the Python script accessible in your shell by entering the following command in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0bf545252b5120845e3b568b9ad0277e/ende.py
* $ man python
These made me realise that this problem must require terminal and not a python compiler, after looking at the man page i tried running the python file through the terminal in shwll using python3. and it gave me an output reguarding the commands usage.

I followed it and used -d flag (for decode) with our file and then provided the password which gave me the flag.
