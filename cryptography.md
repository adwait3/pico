## problem
We found a brand new type of encryption, can you break the secret code? (Wrap with picoCTF{}) lkmjkemjmkiekeijiiigljlhilihliikiliginliljimiklligljiflhiniiiniiihlhilimlhijil
 we are also given the code for the encryption 
 ## hints
 How does the cipher work if the alphabet isn't 26 letters?
 Even though the letters are split up, the same paradigms still apply.

 ## solution 
after going through the code for the encryption i could figure out hoe the encryption works 
* first the code takes the string and converts it into binary which require 8bits per character then splits into groups of 4 bits and concerts them into characters

* then the shift function takes a character c and our key character k and shifts c by k places and we know that our key character is one of the alphabets which gives us 16 possible keys , since 16 is not a large number we can easily bruteforce this.

to get the decryption we can try and reverse the encryption code .
first we make a code for reversing the b_16 encryption.

* in this we iterate over the encoded string in steps of 2 as each char is 4 bits and 2 characters would make a byte.
* then we convert our chunk of two characters(1 byte) to thier binary representation.
 in this expression {0:04b}{1:04b}".format(ALPHABET.index(chunk[0]), ALPHABET.index(chunk[1])):
* o and 1 are the place holders and 04b specifies the format (4 digit binary format)
* the next part gives the index of the first and second character in our chunk.
* after this we convert the binary string to characters and add it to plain.
now we make a reverse for the shifting

this takes a cgaracter c and the key character k and gives the decrypted character by shifting c bacnk by k places inthe alphabets.

next we print all possible decryptions (bruteforce) for every character in the alphabet since we dont know which one is actually the key

this loop iterates in all the alphabets and calls various functions to give the decrypted output for each of them
## final code with output

this gives us the answers and after trial and erroe we get the final key f and decrypted answer et_tu?_431db62c5618cd75f1d0b83832b67b46

## flag

# miniRSA
## problem
Let's decrypt this: ciphertext? Something seems a bit small.
hints
* RSA tutorial
* How could having too small an e affect the security of this 2048 bit key?
* Make sure you don't lose precision, the numbers are pretty big (besides the e value)

## solution

# basic-mod1
## problem
We found this weird message being passed around on the servers, we think we have a working decryption scheme.
Download the message here.
Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set: 0-25 is the alphabet (uppercase), 26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an underscore.
Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})
hints
* Do you know what mod 37 means?
* mod 37 means modulo 37. It gives the remainder of a number after being divided by 37.

## solution
first after opening the message it seemed pretty straightforward

looking at the hints i calculated the mod of each of the numbers giving me

then i mapped these according to the given parameters which gaave me

# basic-mod2
## problem
A new modular challenge!
Download the message here.
Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore.
Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})
hints
* Do you know what the modular inverse is?
* The inverse modulo z of x is the number, y that when multiplied by x is 1 modulo z
* It's recommended to use a tool to find the modular inverses

## solution
first things first i read the file

then like in mod 1 i calculated mod41 for all the digits

22 3 28 26 16 9 26 24 23 10 36 4 16 31 10 31 1 31 1 1 14 1 1  

after this using the hints i calculated inverse modulo for each number manualy which gave me 
28 14 22 30 18 32 30 12 25 37 8 31 18 4 37 4 1 4 1 1 3 1 1
now i mapped these according to the question which gave me
