## PROBLEM:
we are just given a code with no hints.


## BACKGROUND:
first i tried to run the code on a web compiler but i had trouble because of the cryptography module:

after this i tried running the code on vs code but had issues with compiling it which i could not rectify or understand.
SO i tried running the code on idle after installing cryptography module via the terminal.

## SOLUTION:
i was successfully able to run the code on idle after a silpe debugging of the try and except block,which gave me the output as

 after this i tried reading the code and realised the answer only concerns the enter_liscence()
functionand rest were redundant, so i focused my attention there,

this block tells us that
* the lenth of the key should be equal to the key_full_template_trial which is the concatenated string of key_part_static1_trial + key_part_dynamic1_trial + 
 key_part_static2_trial , so we can guess the length of the key from here which is picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_xxxxxxxx} characters long 
* the first part of string is equal to the static portion.
  ow we have to find the second part instead of the xxxxxx portion, loooking at further code we figure out what the next charaxters should be equal to in order to not break from the loop, so i print the statements with which we are checking the key

  this gives me an error stating that Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing so i look for what this means and fnd out that we are given another username bUsername_trial which is already encoded so i use it while printing and this given me the output and i build up my key using thiese and sure enough the key is right and im able to access the full verion of the calculator.

  ## KEY;
  picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_0d208392}


# GDB baby step 1
## PROBLEM:
Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
Disassemble this.

## SOLUTION:
the problem statement in this was pretty much self explanitory and i did exactly everything it specified .
first i learned about gdb and how to use it to dissassemble the file 
after using the help

then i used help all and found

so i used this command to dissasemble the main and found the eax register

i converted this hexadecimal to integer and got 549698

and got the flag

  ## FLAG
  picoCTF{549698}
